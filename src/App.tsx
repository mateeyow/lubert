          "I love being married. It's so great to find that one special person
          you want to annoy for the rest of your life." <br />â€“ Rita Rudner
        </p>
        <p>
          While searching for the best quote that fits perfectly with the
          relationship that you guys have, I happened to read this quote and I
          know it is perfect. Unlike this quote love and marriage will never be
          perfect, far from it. It is a journey of two people working things
          out, discovering each other, understanding each other's shortcomings,
          fighting over small things, and most importantly forgiving each other.
          In the three beautiful, loud, and awesome months that I've been with
          you guys, I've come to realize what made your relationship lasts when
          others cannot - it's <strong>the fights</strong>. Well, it's what
          comes after those fights - <strong>forgiveness.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Wikipedia, forgiveness is the intentional and voluntary
          process by which one who may initially feel victimized, undergoes a
          change in feelings and attitude regarding a given offense, and{" "}
          <strong>
            overcomes negative emotions such as resentment and vengeance
          </strong>
          . I noticed that your fights rarely extend to the next day. You guys
          try to work things out, although sometimes while shouting and banging
          doors, but what's important is that each of you forgives.
          Nevertheless, I hope that you guys will lessen your fights now that
          you are technically a family. Always remember that it's not you versus
          your partner, rather you versus the problem that you are tackling.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would also like to take this opportunity to thank you for "adopting"
          me into your lives. It is rare to find true friends when you grow old,
          and I am lucky to have found two. I am forever grateful for the help
          and encouragement that you guys have given me during my turbulent
          times. You guys were my rock when I felt overwhelmed with the problems
          I was facing. You guys have given me a new perspective in life and
          helped me reflect and rethink what is important -{" "}

          <div className="salutations">To Lu Dan,</div>
          Life, especially creating a new one, is a wonderful experience (or so
          they said, don't really have any kids myself). I hope that you won't
          be afraid in facing this new chapter in your life. I know that you are
          afraid and concerned about raising kids and all its nuisance but
          knowing you and with Albert's help you will be able to overcome it. I
          also hope that you will lengthen your patience with Albert (cause you
          know, it's Albert!!!!), lessen the volume of your voice, and try not
          to throw your frustrations at Albert when you are stressed.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          <div className="salutations">To Albert,</div>
          Stress, sometimes you are the reason why Lu Dan is stressed.
          Hopefully, you can be less annoying to Lu Dan when she is stressed
          (but don't remove it. It won't be Albert anymore if you're not
          annoying). Continue with what you're doing now, but I think it won't
          hurt when you give Lu Dan some surprises, I know girls love surprises
          (wink wink).{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Best wishes and congratulations on this new chapter of your lives. I
          hope when I leave, it won't be the last time I'll be seeing you. I'll
          miss you guys. Love you. <br /> <br />
